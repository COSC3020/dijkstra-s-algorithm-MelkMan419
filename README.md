# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Recall the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm:
- initialize the dist to each vertex to $\infty$, source to 0
- while there are unmarked vertices left in the graph
    - select the unmarked vertex $v$ with the lowest dist
    - mark $v$ with distance dist
    - for each edge $(v,w)$
        - dist($w$) = min $\left(\textrm{dist}(w), \textrm{dist}(v) + \textrm{weight of }(v, w)\right)$

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm. Start with the template I provided in `code.js`
and test your new function.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

The choice of data structures is up to you -- your implementation does not have
to be the most efficient one, but please make sure that it is not unnecessarily
inefficient.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

We iterate over all of the vertices with a for loop to set their distance's from the source node to Infinity, which takes number of vertices or |V| time. Then a while loop that has 2 for loops inside. The first for loop inside the while loop will iterate for |V| because it is searching for the distance to find the next smallest distance. Since this for loop is nested in the while loop, which also iterates for |V|, we get |V|^2. The last for loop inside the while loop is looking at all the edges of each node to see if there is a shorter path to undecided neighbor nodes. Since this implementation is an adjacency matrix, iterating over edges leads the second for loop inside the while loop to run for |V|^2. The if statement checks and variable initializations are constant time and can be dropped for the rest of the calculations. All this together we get: |V| + |V|^2 + |V|^2 which is equal to |V|+2|V|^2 which asytompically we simplify to just |V|^2. So the $\Theta$ is |V|^2
